single-phase induction motor works by first creating
a pulsating magnetic field in the stator when supplied with a
single-phase AC current, which is not enough to start the rotor. 
To overcome this, a starting mechanism is needed to create a more 
effective rotating magnetic field, either by splitting the phase into two 
windings with a capacitor or by using a shaded-pole design. This rotating field the
n induces currents in the rotor, and the interaction between the stator and rotor mag
The double revolving field theory explains how a si
ngle-phase induction motor works by resolving the pulsatin
g magnetic field into two rotating magnetic fields of equal magni
tude that rotate in opposite directions. One is the forward field, and 
the other is the backward field, both rotating at synchronous speed. The net to
rque is the difference between the tor
ques produced by these two fields,netic
fields creates the torque to spin the rotor.
