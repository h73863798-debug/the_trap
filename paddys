Join them right before it’s too late.
Speak it formal, no extra art:
telnet {ip} {port}
or
nc {ip} {port}

You gotta pay the troll tol to get into server's hole.
But to find the one open door you're gonna need to map the network first.

Where suits discuss and athletes train,
Where hungry minds refuel again,
Three paths meet but none are final —
Stand between the sport and vinyl.
Scan the air, don’t trust your sight,
The strongest name will guide you right.
