Wien's displacement law states that the wavelength 
(\(\lambda _{max}\)) at which a blackbody emits the highest intensity 
radiation is inversely proportional to its absolute temperature (\(T\)). As an o
bject's temperature increases, the peak wavelength shifts to shorter (bluer) w
avelengths, following the formula: \(\lambda _{max}T=b\)
(where \(b\approx 2.897\times 10^{-3}\text{\ m}\cdot \text{K}\)).
